## About

[LittleSis](https://littlesis.org) is a free database of who-knows-who at the heights of business and government. It is a public wiki and purpose-built database for researching powerful organizations, tracking conflicts of interest, and visualizing networks of political influence. LittleSis started in 2009 and our database contains over 1.5 million relationships between over 400 thousand people and organizations.

LittleSis.org is operated by the [Public Accountability Initiative](https://public-accountability.org), an independent non-profit organization. The project is currently maintained by [ziggy](mailto:ziggy@littlesis.org).
