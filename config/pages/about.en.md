# About LittleSis

LittleSis is a free database detailing the connections between powerful people and organizations. We bring transparency to influential social networks by tracking the key relationships of politicians, business leaders, lobbyists, financiers, and their affiliated institutions. We help answer questions such as:

- Who do the wealthiest Americans donate their money to?
- Where did White House officials work before they were appointed?
- Which lobbyists are married to politicians, and who do they lobby for?

All of this information is public, but scattered. We bring it together in one place. Our data derives from government filings, news articles, and other reputable sources. Some data sets are updated automatically; the rest is filled in by our user community.

**LittleSis lets you see past the news headlines and tired debates.**

Who are the movers and shakers behind the bailouts, government contracts, and new policies? Weâ€™re working to stock LittleSis with information about bigwigs who make the news, and their connections to those who don't. For updates and analysis visit our blog, [Eyes on the Ties](https://news.littlesis.org)

LittleSis is a project of Public Accountability Initiative, a 501(c)3 organization focused on corporate and government accountability.

PAI was founded in early 2008 by a group of activists, public interest lawyers, and academics associated with leading universities and major social change organizations.
