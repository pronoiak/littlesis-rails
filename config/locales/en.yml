        LittleSis is bringing together a community of researchers who believe in transparency and accountability in our society and economy. Our task is to study, document, and expose the social networks that have our democracy in a stranglehold, so that grassroots efforts can more effectively challenge their claim to power.
        We're looking for researchers, programmers, artists and organizers to be a part of our activist researcher community. If you want to get involved sign up to become a LittleSis analyst and start adding information to the site. You can check out our %{videos_link} for information on how to use all the tools on our site.
        If you’re interested in connecting with other power researchers in your region and doing local or regional power mapping of your city or state, check out our %{toolkit_link} toolkit and sign up %{join_link} to be part of our national network of researchers for the resistance!

        LittleSis presents an exciting opportunity: editors (called "analysts" on LittleSis) are developing an unprecedented, authoritative database of key relationships between powerful Americans.
        Sign up to edit the profile pages of your (least) favorite fatcats.
        To request an account, please provide the following information. We promise not to share it with anyone, ever!

        I understand that LittleSis's mission is to track people and groups with inordinate wealth, influence on public policy, and access to government officials. As a LittleSis analyst it is my responsibility to ensure that information I contribute is relevant to the site's mission, accurate, and documented by publicly available original sources on the internet. The LittleSis staff can revoke my editing privileges or disable my account if they believe I am not following these guidelines in good faith. LittleSis staff can revoke my editing privileges and remove any edits, maps, or lists that I create that are in violation of these terms of use including:
          <ul>
            <li>Contributions that promote violence or hate against a marginalized group or use hate speech</li>
            <li>Contributions that fall outside the purview of our mission to track people and groups with inordinate wealth and influence</li>
            <li>Contributions that spam the database</li>
          </ul>
        I understand that if I am in violation of any of these terms of use my account will be restricted from editing while LittleSis staff investigate and delete any data that is inappropriate for the site. If the violation occurred by accident I can appeal to have my editing restrictions lifted, however this is at the discretion of LittleSis staff. Repeated violations will result in a suspension of my LittleSis account.
